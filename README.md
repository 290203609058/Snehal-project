 A Web Mining Approach to Collaborative Consumption of Food            

Introduction:
          Collaborative consumption (CC) is a new form of consumer behavior with important implications for business research (Benoit et al., 2017). CC takes place when people coordinate the acquisition and distribution of a resource. It is “the peer-to-peer-based activity of obtaining, giving, or sharing the access to goods and services, coordinated through community-based online services” CC is present in a vast range of business, such as transportation and online food delivery services (Just-Eat.com, Clickdelivery.com, UberEATS) .
                 Online food delivery services (OFD) offer opportunities for research as they are underrepresented in the literature of CC. According to Pigatto et al. (2017) these services can be characterized as business platforms that provide order services, payment and monitoring of the process but are not responsible for the preparation and order delivery operations. Although large fast-food chains like McDonald's or Domino's Pizza offer their delivery services, small or medium restaurants chains have seized the emergence of intermediaries that provide these sort of services
